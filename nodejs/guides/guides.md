## How to use this image

Before you can use any Docker Hardened Image, you must mirror the image
repository from the catalog to your organization. To mirror the repository,
select either **Mirror to repository** or **View in repository** > **Mirror to
repository**, and then follow the on-screen instructions.

### What's included in this image

This Docker Hardened Node.js image includes the Node.js runtime in a minimal, security-hardened package:

- Node.js runtime: Complete runtime for running Node.js applications
- npm: Package manager for Node.js (in dev variants only)
- Container optimizations: Pre-configured for non-root execution
- Security hardening: No shell, no package manager in runtime variants, minimal attack surface

### Start a Node.js image

Run the following command and replace <your-namespace> with your organization's namespace and <tag> with the image variant you want to run:

```
docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<tag> node --version
```

### Common Node.js use cases

#### Run a Node.js application

Run your Node.js application directly from the container:

```json
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<tag>-dev node index.js
```

### Build and run a Node.js application

The recommended way to use this image is to use a multi-stage Dockerfile with
the `dev` variant as the build environment and the runtime variant as the
runtime environment. In your Dockerfile, writing something along the lines of
the following will compile and run a simple project.


```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Use a tag with the -dev suffix (e.g., 22-dev)
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<tag> AS build-stage

ENV NODE_ENV=production
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN --mount=type=bind,source=package.json,target=package.json \
    --mount=type=bind,source=package-lock.json,target=package-lock.json \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --omit=dev

# Use the same tag as above but without the -dev suffix (e.g., 22)
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<tag> AS runtime-stage

ENV NODE_ENV=production
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY --from=build-stage /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY src ./src
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```
$ docker build -t my-node-app .
$ docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --name my-running-app my-node-app
```

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

To migrate your application to a Docker Hardened Image, you must update your
Dockerfile. At minimum, you must update the base image in your existing
Dockerfile to a Docker Hardened Image. This and a few other common changes are
listed in the following table of migration notes.

|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base image         | Replace your base images in your Dockerfile with a Docker Hardened Image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Package management | Non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain package managers. Use package managers only in images with a `dev` tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Nonroot user       | By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, run as a nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to that user.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Multi-stage build  | Utilize images with a `dev` tag for build stages and non-dev images for runtime. For binary executables, use a `static` image for runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| TLS certificates   | Docker Hardened Images contain standard TLS certificates by default. There is no need to install TLS certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ports              | Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images canâ€™t bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container. |
| Entry point        | Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.                                                                                                                                  |
| No shell           | By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy artifacts to the runtime stage.                                                                                                                                                  |


## Image variants

Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended
use. Image variants are identified by their tag.

- Runtime variants are designed to run your application in production. These
  images are intended to be used either directly or as the `FROM` image in the
  final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:
    - Run as a nonroot user
    - Do not include a shell or a package manager
    - Contain only the minimal set of libraries needed to run the app

- Build-time variants typically include `dev` in the tag name and are
  intended for use in the first stage of a multi-stage Dockerfile. These images
  typically:
    - Run as the root user
    - Include a shell and package manager
    - Are used to build or compile applications

To view the image variants and get more information about them, select the
**Tags** tab for this repository, and then select a tag.

### Why no shell or package manager in runtime variants?

Docker Hardened Images prioritize security through minimalism:

- Reduced attack surface: Fewer binaries mean fewer potential vulnerabilities
- Immutable infrastructure: Runtime containers shouldn't be modified after deployment
- Compliance ready: Meets strict security requirements for regulated environments

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. Common debugging methods for applications built with Docker Hardened Images include:

- Docker Debug to attach to containers
- Docker's Image Mount feature to mount debugging tools
- Application-level logging and monitoring

- Docker Debug provides a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only exists during the debugging session.

- For example, you can use Docker Debug:

```
docker debug <container-name>
```

to get a debug shell into any container or image, even if they don't contain a shell.

### FIPS variants

Docker Hardened Node.js images include FIPS-compliant variants for environments requiring Federal Information Processing Standards compliance.

FIPS variant naming:

- Runtime: <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version>-fips
- Development: <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version>-fips-dev

#### Steps to verify FIPS:

```json
# Check FIPS status (should return 1 for enabled)
docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version>-fips \
  node -e "console.log('FIPS status:', require('crypto').getFips ? require('crypto').getFips() : 'FIPS method not available')"

# Verify cipher restrictions (FIPS has significantly fewer available)
docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version>-fips \
  node -e "console.log('FIPS ciphers:', require('crypto').getCiphers().length)"

docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version> \
  node -e "console.log('Non-FIPS ciphers:', require('crypto').getCiphers().length)"

# Test disabled cryptographic functions (MD5 disabled in FIPS)
docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<version>-fips \
  node -e "
  try {
    require('crypto').createHash('md5').update('test').digest('hex');
    console.log('MD5: Available');
  } catch(e) {
    console.log('MD5: Disabled -', e.message);
  }"
 ```


#### Runtime requirements specific to FIPS:

- FIPS mode enforces stricter cryptographic standards
- Weak cryptographic functions like MD5 are disabled and will fail at runtime
- Applications using restricted algorithms may need modification
- Only FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms are available (~60% fewer than non-FIPS)


### Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

The following steps outline the general migration process.

1. Find hardened images for your app.

   A hardened image may have several variants. Inspect the image tags and find
   the image variant that meets your needs. Node.js images are available in versions 18, 20, 22 and 24

2. Update the base image in your Dockerfile.

   Update the base image in your application's Dockerfile to the hardened image
   you found in the previous step. For framework images, this is typically going
   to be an image tagged as `dev` because it has the tools needed to install
   packages and dependencies.

3. For multi-stage Dockerfiles, update the runtime image in your Dockerfile.

   To ensure that your final image is as minimal as possible, you should use a
   multi-stage build. All stages in your Dockerfile should use a hardened image.
   While intermediary stages will typically use images tagged as `dev`, your
   final runtime stage should use a non-dev image variant.

4. Install additional packages

   Docker Hardened Images contain minimal packages in order to reduce the
   potential attack surface. You may need to install additional packages in your
   Dockerfile. To view if a package manager is available for an image variant,
   select the **Tags** tab for this repository. To view what packages are
   already installed in an image variant, select the **Tags** tab for this
   repository, and then select a tag.

   Only images tagged as `dev` typically have package managers. You should use a
   multi-stage Dockerfile to install the packages. Install the packages in the
   build stage that uses a `dev` image. Then, if needed, copy any necessary
   artifacts to the runtime stage that uses a non-dev image.

   For Alpine-based images, you can use `apk` to install packages. For
   Debian-based images, you can use `apt-get` to install packages.

## Troubleshooting migration

The following are common issues that you may encounter during migration.

### General debugging

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for
debugging. The recommended method for debugging applications built with Docker
Hardened Images is to use [Docker
Debug](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/debug/) to attach to these
containers. Docker Debug provides a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you
install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only exists during the
debugging session.

### Permissions

By default image variants intended for runtime, run as a nonroot user. Ensure
that necessary files and directories are accessible to that user. You may
need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your
application running as a nonroot user can access them.

 To view the user for an image variant, select the **Tags** tab for this
 repository.

### Privileged ports

Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result,
applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when
running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid
issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the
container, even if you map it to a lower port on the host. For example, `docker
run -p 80:8080 my-image` will work because the port inside the container is 8080,
and `docker run -p 80:81 my-image` won't work because the port inside the
container is 81.

### No shell

By default, image variants intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use `dev`
images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy any necessary
artifacts into the runtime stage. In addition, use Docker Debug to debug
containers with no shell.

 To see if a shell is available in an image variant and which one, select the
 **Tags** tab for this repository.

### Entry point

Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as
Docker Official Images.

To view the Entrypoint or CMD defined for an image variant, select the **Tags**
tab for this repository, select a tag, and then select the **Specifications**
tab.
