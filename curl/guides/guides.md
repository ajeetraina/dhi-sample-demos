## How to use this image

### Start a curl DHI container

Replace `<your-namespace>` with your organization's namespace and `<tag>` with the image variant you want to run.

```
# Using Alpine variant (recommended for minimal size)
$ docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-curl:<tag>-alpine3.22 --version

# Using Debian variant (for compatibility)
$ docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-curl:<tag> --version
```

## Common curl DHI use cases

### Basic HTTP requests

Execute simple HTTP requests:

```bash
# GET request (Alpine variant recommended for CI/CD)
$ docker run --rm dockerdevrel/dhi-curl:8.14.1-alpine3.22 https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cagent

# POST request with data
$ docker run --rm dockerdevrel/dhi-curl:8.14.1-alpine3.22 \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"key":"value"}' \
    https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cagent/issues
```

### File operations with volume mounts

Download files or work with local data:

```bash
# Upload file from host
mkdir -p /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test

# Create a simple test file
echo '{"project": "docker/cagent", "test": "upload", "timestamp": "'$(date)'"}' > /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test/upload-test.json

# Upload file to docker/cagent repository
docker run --rm -v /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test:/data dockerdevrel/dhi-curl:8.14.1-alpine3.22 \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -T /data/upload-test.json \
    https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cagent/issues

# Verify the file was created
ls -la /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test/
cat /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test/upload-test.json

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/curl-dhi-file-test
```


### Multi-stage Dockerfile integration

**Important**: Curl DHI images are runtime-only variants. Curl DHI does not provide separate dev variants.

Here's a complete example for integration testing:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Development stage - Use standard curl for setup and testing
FROM curlimages/curl AS test-setup

WORKDIR /app

# Install testing tools and dependencies (standard image has package managers)
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache jq bash

# Download docker/cagent configuration during build
RUN curl -o cagent-config.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/cagent/main/README.md || \
    echo '{"agent_name": "default", "project": "docker/cagent"}' > cagent-config.json

# Test docker/cagent repository availability during build
RUN curl --fail --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cagent > /dev/null && \
    echo "docker/cagent repository accessible"

# Create a simple configuration file
RUN echo '{"curl_config": "production", "endpoints": ["docker/cagent", "docker/mcp-gateway"]}' > config.json

# Runtime stage - Curl DHI for production deployment
FROM dockerdevrel/dhi-curl:8.14.1-alpine3.22 AS runtime

WORKDIR /app

# Copy prepared configuration from setup stage
COPY --from=test-setup /app/config.json /app/config.json

# Default command to check docker/cagent status
CMD ["https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cagent"]
```

To build and test this:

```
# Build the multi-stage image
docker build -t my-curl-dhi-app .

# Run the application
docker run --rm my-curl-dhi-app

# Test with different endpoint
docker run --rm my-curl-dhi-app https://api.github.com/repos/docker/mcp-gateway
```


## Non-hardened images vs Docker Hardened Images

| Feature | Standard curl Images | Docker Hardened curl |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Security** | Standard base with common utilities | Hardened base with reduced utilities |
| **Shell access** | Full shell access (bash/ash) | No shell access |
| **Package manager** | Full package managers (apk, apt) | System package managers removed |
| **User** | Runs as curl user or root | Runs as nonroot user |
| **Attack surface** | Full system utilities available | Significantly reduced |
| **System utilities** | Full system toolchain (ls, cat, id, ps, find, rm present) | Extremely minimal (ls, cat, id, ps, find, rm removed) |
| **Variants** | Multiple variants for different use cases | Runtime-only (no dev variants) |
| **SSL/TLS** | Full certificate management tools | Basic certificates included |



## Image variants

Docker Hardened curl images are runtime-only variants. It doesn't provide separate dev variants with additional development tools.

**Runtime variants** are designed to run curl commands in production. These images are intended to be used either directly or as the FROM image in the final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:

- Run as the nonroot user
- Contain ONLY the curl binary (no shell, no system utilities)
- Support HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols curl supports
- Require `docker debug` for any debugging needs

### Choosing between variants

**Alpine variants** (`8.14.1-alpine3.22`):
- **Pros**: Smallest size (~5MB), fastest downloads, ideal for CI/CD
- **Cons**: Limited system libraries, musl libc instead of glibc
- **Use when**: Bandwidth matters, simple HTTP operations, container orchestration

**Debian variants** (`8.14.1-debian13`):
- **Pros**: Better compatibility, glibc, more predictable behavior
- **Cons**: Larger size (~15MB), longer download times
- **Use when**: Complex applications, compatibility requirements, enterprise environments

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

To migrate your curl deployment to Docker Hardened Images, you must update your deployment configuration and potentially your Dockerfile.

| Item | Migration note |
|------|----------------|
| **Base image** | Replace standard curl images with Docker Hardened curl images |
| **Package management** | System package managers removed (apk/apt removed) |
| **Protocol support** | Basic protocols supported, some advanced features may be limited |
| **Non-root user** | Runtime images run as nonroot user |
| **Multi-stage build** | Use standard curl images for setup stages and curl DHI for final deployment |
| **TLS certificates** | Standard certificates included |
| **File permissions** | Ensure mounted files are accessible to nonroot user |
| **System utilities** | Runtime images lack ALL system utilities (ls, cat, id, ps, find, rm removed) |
| **Shell access** | NO shell exists - cannot run shell commands or override entrypoint to shell |
| **Debugging** | Requires docker debug for any debugging needs | 


## Migration Process

The following steps outline the general migration process.

1. Find hardened images for your app.

   A hardened image may have several variants. Inspect the image tags and find
   the image variant that meets your needs.

2. Update the base image in your Dockerfile.

   Update the base image in your application's Dockerfile to the hardened image
   you found in the previous step. Note that curl DHI does not provide `dev`
   variants - use standard curl images (like `curlimages/curl`) for build stages that require package installation and development tools.

4. For multi-stage Dockerfiles, update the runtime image in your Dockerfile.

   To ensure that your final image is as minimal as possible, you should use a multi-stage build. Build stages should use standard curl images for development tasks, while your final runtime stage should use curl DHI for maximum security

5. Install additional packages

   Docker Hardened Images contain minimal packages in order to reduce the potential attack surface.
   You may need to install additional packages in your Dockerfile.
   Inspect the image variants to identify which packages are already installed.

   Curl DHI has no `dev` variants and no package managers.
   You must use a multi-stage Dockerfile with standard curl images (like `curlimages/curl`) for the build stage.
   Install packages in the build stage using standard images, then copy any necessary artifacts to the curl DHI runtime stage.

   For Alpine-based build stages, you can use `apk` to install packages. For Debian-based build stages, you can use `apt-get` to install packages.

## Troubleshooting migration

The following are common issues that you may encounter during migration.

### General debugging

Curl DHI runtime images contain NO shell or system utilities for debugging. Commands like `ls`, `cat`, `id`, `ps`, `find`, and `rm` are completely removed, and no shell exists. The only method for debugging applications built with Docker Hardened Images is to use `docker debug` to attach to these containers.

```bash
# Debug a running curl DHI container
$ docker debug <container-id>
```

### Permissions

By default, runtime image variants run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to the nonroot user. You may need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your application running as the nonroot user can access them.

### Privileged ports

Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container, even if you map it to a lower port on the host. For example, `docker run -p 80:8080 my-image` will work because the port inside the container is `808`0, and `docker run -p 80:81 my-image` won't work because the port inside the container is `81`.

### No shell

Runtime image variants do not contain a shell. Use standard curl images (like `curlimages/curl`) in build stages to run shell commands and then copy any necessary artifacts into the curl DHI runtime stage. In addition, use `docker debug` to debug containers with no shell.

### Entry point

Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Use `docker inspect` to inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary. Curl DHI uses `curl` as the entrypoint.
